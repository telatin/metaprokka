# MetaProkka
ðŸ§« â™Š MetaProkka | Modified version of Prokka by Torsten Seeman tailored for metagenome assemblies

### Preamble

As a long time [Prokka](https://github.com/tseeman/prokka) user, I made some changes for the specific use for metagenomes. 

**Prokka**'s author will probably release a better replacement (called Mokka) in the future, so keep al look [here](https://github.com/tseeman/mokka).

This repository contains the altered script and its documentation, after experimenting with [this fork](https://github.com/telatin/prokka).
